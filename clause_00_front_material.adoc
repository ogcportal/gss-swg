[big]*i.     Abstract*

Agile spatial data infrastructures, based on OGC standards, allow data provider
organizations to deploy increasingly efficient networks capable of responding
to dynamic requirements for using geospatial data.  In this context, data
provider organizations are being more and more called upon to deliver current,
timely and verified data over the World Wide Web. In order to satisfy these
requirements, data providers must collaborate with outside entities to collect
new data and/or update their existing data holdings.  This may, for example,
mean synchronizing their data with closest-to-source providers as might be the
case between municipal, state/provincial and/or federal levels of government.
This may also mean crowd-sourcing (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing)
their data production or supporting volunteer geographic information (VGI).
Crowd-sourcing or VGI has proven to be a very effective tool for emergency
management / disaster relief situations as is evidenced by the response to the
Haiti earthquake of 12th January, 2010. Regardless of the nature of the collaboration,
there is a need for a service to mediate the interaction between data providers
and outside entities acting as data collectors.  The service must support data
entry with validation, notification of changes to interested parties and allow
synchronization of external services with the data provider's features.

A Geo-Synchronization service, deployed by a data provider, sits between the
provider's data store(s) and "the crowd" and supports the following functions:

1. The service provides authentication and role-based access control so that a data provider can define who is authorized to propose changes (i.e. a member of "the crowd" and  who or what is authorized to validate proposed changes before they are applied to the data provider's data store(s).

2. It allows members of "the crowd" to submit proposals for new data, for modifications to existing data, or for the removal of existing data without directly affecting the data in the provider's data store(s) until validation has been applied to the proposal thus ensuring that the data published by the provider is of high quality.

3. It allows interested parties (i.e. subscribers) to be notified whenever any change (i.e. event) of interest occurs on the system.  The types of changes that can be tracked include proposed changes, the disposition of proposed changes and proposed changes that have been accepted and applied to the data provider's data store(s).

4. It supports synchronization of external data stores with the data provider's features.  This can be a passive process whereby the external service periodically interrogates the Geo-Synchronization service to determine which changes have occurred or an active process whereby the Geo-Synchronization service pushes changes to external services as they occur.

This candidate standard makes no assumption about the nature of the validation
or the quality criteria that a provider has established; only that the
Geo-Synchronization service allows the data to be evaluated for quality by 
an authorized entity(ies) before being applied to the provider's data store(s).
For example, changes submitted by trusted members of the crowd may be applied
directly to the provider's data stores while data obtained from untrusted 
sources would be subjected to more rigorous validation. Validation might
involve a manual process where authorized human reviewers check each submitted
piece of data to assess its quality.  Similarly, automated heuristics might be
applied to assess the quality of the data.  In any case, the data is validated
before being applied to the data  provider's data store(s).

Interested parties (or subscribers) must be able to flexibly track which
changes have been submitted by "the crowd", what the disposition of those
changes was (i.e. whether the changes were accepted or rejected by the
validation process) and also track the actual changes applied to feature in the
provider's data store(s) for the purpose of synchronization.  This flexible
notification capability is achieved by allowing subscribers to create
"standing queries" that include predicates that precisely identify about which
events they are interested in being notified.  For example, a subscriber might
register that they are interested in receiving notifications about proposed
changes made within a specific geographic area.

Finally, a Geo-Synchronization service must support the synchronization of 
external services with information in the data provider's data store(s).
The Geo-Synchronization service maintains an event channel containing a
log of all changes made to features in the data provider's data store(s).
This channel may be used to support passive or active synchronization.
In passive synchronization, interested external entities periodically read
the event channel and any new changes to their data store(s).  In active
synchronization, interested external entities subscribe to the
Geo-Synchronization service which then push changes to the external entity's
data store(s) as they occur.  Synchronization may be full or partial depending
on the filters defined to identify events of interest.  Synchronization may
possibly involve a schema translation for the provider's feature schema to
the feature schema of the synchronizing server.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

Currently, there is no prior art within the OGC on the topic of volunteered
geographic information (VGI) or crowdsourcing.  This standard addresses these
topics by defining a service to manage the process of VGI or crowdsourced 
data collection in a way that allows the data to be reviewed by responsible
parties before being entered into a datastore.  The content of this standard
integrates the work of a number of OGC testbeds including the GeoConnections
Canadian Geospatial Data Infrastructure (CGDI) Pilot, OGC Testbed 11, OGC
Testbed 12, OGC Testbed 13 and incorporates work done during the development
of the OGC Publish/Subscribe Interface Standard.
